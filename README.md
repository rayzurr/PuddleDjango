# PuddleDjango
A marketplace 'Puddle' created using Django inspired by YT Tutorial @FreeCodeCamp


I noticed I spelt ‘catergory/catergories’ wrong and and searched and replaced to ‘category/catergories’.

That brought me a error. I believe it has to do with my database tables and migrations.

running 'python manage.py inspectdb' shows that my some tables are still named as Item_Catergory
